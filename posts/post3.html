                As with the holonomic car, we aim to find the best PID controller values for the Ackermann car so that it can complete various circuits in a reasonable time and with minimal oscillation. To achieve this, a system has been set up using two pairs of controllers—one for straight sections and another for curves. Both speed and steering angle are calculated based on the error between the center of the image and the center of the lane, taking into account the camera’s lateral offset.

                <br><br>Because the Ackermann car is inherently more prone to oscillations, numerous trials were required to balance acceptable speed with reduced swaying. Ultimately, an optimal compromise was reached by setting a <b>base speed of 16</b> for curves, accompanied by more conservative PID controllers that lower speed when errors are larger and avoid overly aggressive steering corrections. For straight sections, a <b>base speed of 24</b> and more aggressive PID controllers were chosen to cover these stretches faster, even if the vehicle does not stay precisely on top of the line.

                <br><br>To smooth out the control, a <b>10-pixel “dead zone”</b> was implemented, meaning that any error within that range does not trigger corrections, thus avoiding continuous minor steering adjustments. Additionally, a <b>“straightness” threshold of 0.6</b> determines when the car is on a straight section, at which point the system switches to the respective straight-controller pair.

                <br><br>With these adjustments, the car can complete the basic circuit in <b>180 seconds</b> with acceptable oscillations. The remaining circuits are also completed, albeit in longer times—<b>500 s, 600 s, and 700 s</b>, respectively—depending on their complexity.
